    </h1>
    <img class="whoim"src="ab3 (1).jpg" alt="Forest" >
    <p class="whopara">One of the leading casual dining chains in India,zomatt pioneered the concept of “over the table barbeque” live grills embedded in dining tables – allowing guests to grill their own barbecue’s right at their tables. Barbeque Nation was founded in 2006 with the concept of 'all you can eat'. We currently own and operate around 200 outlets in India, 4 outlets in UAE, 1 outlet in Malaysia and 1 outlet in Oman.

        Indian cuisine is a natural part of the diet in the markets in which the Barbeque Nation Restaurants operate. We continue to offer new menu options, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, largely based on Indian cuisine and use seasonal customer preferences to introduce new dishes. We also run popular food festivals at our Barbeque Nation Restaurants, thereby offering our customers a range of Indian and international cuisines..</p>
